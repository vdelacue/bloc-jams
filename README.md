Bloc Jams, a digital music player like Spotify used to learn frontend web development
### **Summary**
Bloc Jams is a free digital music player site that allows the user to listen to the music of their choice. The site features unlimited streaming, ad-free, with the added feature of mobile enabled platforms. Users can listen to their music on the go or at home without limit or ad distractions.

### **Explanation**
Bloc Jams was my first major project during my career at Bloc.io. The site consists of a Landing (home) Page that provides information regarding the attractive features of the site: including being able to choose your own music, unlimited streaming, ad-free listening, and mobile enabled platforms to listen to music on the go. From the home page the user is able to navigate to the Library Page (‘collections’). This page includes lists of albums that the user is free to choose. Once the user selects an album they are directed to an Album Page that includes a fully functional and interactive player bar with volume controls. Here the user can see the lists of songs within an album and can play, pause and skip songs at their discretion as well as adjust volume.  
In *phase two* I chose to style the pages very differently using **CSS** and **b

### **Problem**
The Bloc Jams project fell victim to a common issue in front-end web development, lengthy, redundant and complex code. This also brought up the issue "am I Using the best suited framework for single page application?".

### **Solution**
Refactoring was needed in both phase one and phase two because of the common issue in front-end web development mentioned above: lengthy, redundant, and complex code. The Solution was to take the **Vanilla Javascript** and refactor it with **JQuery** in Phase One and then the entire application from phase one was refactored in phase two using **React**. React was clearly better suited to execute this single page application.

In order to understand the functionality and what **JQuery** accomplishes, I needed to learn plain javascript.

Similarly, phase one was instrumental in being able to understand and execute phase two. Phase two involved refactoring all the code in a new project using **React**. It is important to see that phase one forced you to write the entire site using the basic fundamentals of front-end web development, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Vanilla Javascript** and **JQuery**. Many of the frameworks, libraries and packages used today bypass the need to write such lengthy code and make frontend web development much easier. However it is important to understand what all these frameworks libraries and packages are accomplishing behind the scenes. This knowledge is essential to really understand programming and what is happening when a user enters and interacts with a site or application. Phase one although not commonly practiced taught fundamentals that paved the way for phase two.

### **Results**
By using **React** I was able to leverage the power of a full programming language like **Javascript** to build views this includes temporary variables, flow controls, and directly rendering **Javascript** values in scope.

### **Conclusion**
There are many programmers out in the world that blindly use libraries, frameworks and packages without knowing what they are executing or doing behind the scenes. It is very similar to the way people use the english language and use acronyms without knowing their meaning or what they stand for. Of course you can properly use many words without knowing their origin or true meaning. For example, many people use the word *zip* code every day not knowing that it stands for “Zoning Improvement Plan” a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) since 1963. *Laser* stands for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”, *Scuba* stands for “Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, *Taser* stands for “Thomas A Swift Electric Rifle, *CARE* Package stands for “Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere” Packages, and so on…

The point is, all these acronyms are used by people regularly in communication, without these people being aware of the meaning behind these words. A similar situation occurs in programming. Many shortcuts, abbreviations, packages, libraries and frameworks have been created and adopted by programmers. These programmers have not bothered to learn what these consolidated lines of code actually mean. Luckily, thanks to this project I do not fall victim to this “TechnoTardic” Naiveté. Thus with phase one and two concluded, I was given a solid foundation for frontend web development.
